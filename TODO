- write function to add default value to the:
	- index (index.html by default)


HTTPResponse:
- write as a separate function which handles proper routing:
	- security check (will be done by asagymba)
	- index.html by default
	- proper error code return
	- routing throw location
		- proper validation of access + custom error pages is possible as well?? (not implemented)
	- this function should set proper error_code and return full path or "" in return (can be disscussed)

- probable it should be beneficial to add map header:value and then when building a header it just add everything to the response header (I don't now for now how our header will vary)

inet_pton():
	Syscall is forbidden. Rewrite.

REMAINING:
	ClientConnection (handleWriteEvent())
	HTTPResponse
	ServerManager

Implement PUT method.
	Without it, receiving and saving new files
	from the client is hard to implement.
	We can achieve this through CGI, but I'm not sure
	if evalutors would be fine with it...
