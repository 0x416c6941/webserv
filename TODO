- move validateFile function to utils to reuse latter
+ write function to validate that there's no duplicated address
	(any host + port combination + full endpointlisten)
- write function to add default value to the:
	- root = "./"
	- host = "0.0.0.0" (if there's port, but no host and endpointlisten)
	- index (index.html by default)
	- default_error_pages (default one)
- create default error_pages
- check if all file descriptors, including epoll, are properly closed during:
	some connection removal;
	program closing.


HTTPRequest should not throw an error, but return error code or smthing like that
write wrapper for HTTPRequest to catch errors and return error code


Idea:
