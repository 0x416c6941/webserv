- move validateFile function to utils to reuse latter
+ write function to validate that there's no duplicated address
	(any host + port combination + full endpointlisten)
- write function to add default value to the:
	+ root = "./"
	+ host = "0.0.0.0" (if there's port, but no host and endpointlisten)
	- index (index.html by default)
	- default_error_pages (default one)
+ create default error_pages
- check if all file descriptors, including epoll, are properly closed during:
	some connection removal;
	program closing.


HTTPRequest should not throw an error, but return error code or smthing like that
write wrapper for HTTPRequest to catch errors and return error code

In conf file can be specified: large_client_header_buffers (we don't support it) 

HTTPRequest should not parse until obtain entire header
	- url can be very long as well as header -> set in httpreques max_header_size(we didn't implement it in ServerConfig)
		also chceck _client_max_body_size -> we have implemented it in ServerConfig
	- untill header is finished do not parse! if there will be corrupted msg without \r\t\r\t -> close connection by timeout or just leave as it is (Konstantin advise)
